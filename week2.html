            <p class="reflection-para" >Week 2 was largely centered around ideation, allowing us to develop and visualise ideas for this project. In class, we were asked to do 'crazy 9's', an ideation game that promotes quick thinking and creative problem solving. I unfortunately forgot to take photos of these crazy 8's, thus came up with some more outside of class. At this time, I became set on the idea of creating an analog feeling website based around the idea of a tangible 'workbook'. I really liked the idea of flipping pages, interactive erasers and scanning in various paper textures.</p>
            <p class="reflection-para"> However, once I started playing around with the html and css, I realised that my ideas were not being translated how I was intending. I also did not like the visual aesethic and identity of the concept, and discovered I tend to enjoy cleaner design styles. I realised that to pull off what I was visualising would require a higher skillset, and considering I am new to coding I thought maybe I should be realistic and simplify my concept.
