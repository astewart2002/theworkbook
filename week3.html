            <p class="reflection-para" >Week 3 for me was a LOT of trial and error. A lot of my week was spent being too ambitious with concepts and dialling it back in. I completely abandoned the idea of an analog feeling website and decided to go with a more modern feeling website. I still wanted interactive and fun elements, and decided to make a fun landing page beckoning users to 'enter'. I followed some online tutorials to create the custom cursor effect, and the terminal typing effect.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection-para"> When searching the internet for UI inspiration, I came across an image that showed text in rounded text boxes, positioned as though they has fallen down to the bottom of the screen in a haphazard way. I  thought it would be fun to make a gif loosely based on this image, and that's where the idea for the gif on my home page came from. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection-para"> Overall, my site is fairly simple with a few fun interactive elements to add a point of interest. Considering I am relatively new to coding, I am proud of my progress in this subject, and am eager to see how much more I can grow.
