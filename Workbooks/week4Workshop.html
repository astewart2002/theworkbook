            <p class="reflection-para" >Week 4 introduced us to what an element of chance can look like in both analog and digital formats. The activity prompted us to work with a partner in class to determine a set of parameters that can influence how a game is played. Our game employed two dice which would influence the size, colour, shape, and position of a shape on the page.

            <!-- <p class="reflection-para"> When searching the internet for UI inspiration, I came across an image that showed text in rounded text boxes, positioned as though they has fallen down to the bottom of the screen in a haphazard way. I  thought it would be fun to make a gif loosely based on this image, and that's where the idea for the gif on my home page came from. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection-para"> Overall, my site is fairly simple with a few fun interactive elements to add a point of interest. Considering I am relatively new to coding, I am proud of my progress in this subject, and am eager to see how much more I can grow.
