            <p class="reflection-para" >Week 1 prompted us to consider everyday gestures between machines and devices. Gestures to operate devices and machines have become largely unconscious to me, as I use them so frequently without effort. Gestures such as scrolling, clicking, tapping and swiping are so intrinsic to the way I operate devices that the removal of any of these single gestures would result in a completely different way of interacting with devices. This exercise was interesting, as it prompted me to consider how little communication between people and devices is actually verbal. So much of our language, whether that be digital or physical is gestural. This is something I hadn't ever really considered.

            <p class="reflection-para" > When asked to draw a familiar website from memory, I chose gmail, a website I access frequenly (unfortunately). Despite interacting with this website daily, there were still numerous features I forgot when recalling the interface. These were predominantly features I use less frequently, and are thus less memorable. The last activity we did was through the designercize site. I unfortunately did not take a photo of the wireframe my group came up with in class, but did however make another attempt in my own time. This helped me visualise main elements of an interface, and break down visual elements into specific html tags. It was intersting coming up with a creative solution to a specific design prompt, and it fostered some interesting conversations with peers, as well as some critical thinking.
